exodus (1.42.0-1) xenial; urgency=high

  * Improved rescan reliability in the case of overloaded servers. Exodus now
    attempts server connections, up to 5 times, before reporting an error. This
    extra buffer helps servers peaking with very high traffic.
  * Updated asset descriptions, including future beta assets, in the settings
    section.
  * When sweeping a paper wallet from the advanced developer menu, because funds
    are moved on-chain, Exodus now previews the required transaction fee and
    prompts for confirmation.

    design choices made at Coinbase and seems to help users from mistaking
    Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin when sending and receiving.

    well as a general cleanup of extra items causing confusion.

 -- R. Douglas Barbieri <doug@dooglio.net>  Thu, 04 Jan 2018 21:28:00 -0800

exodus (1.41.0-1) xenial; urgency=high

  * Exodus notifies you if you are sending all your Ethereum and have
    Ethereum-powered assets (sometimes called ERC20).
  * Optimized Ethereum and Ethereum Classic gas prices.

    Report Data) to easily package only safe Exodus report data for diagnostic by the

 -- R. Douglas Barbieri <doug@dooglio.net>  Mon, 27 Nov 2017 08:35:02 -0800

exodus (1.39.1-1) xenial; urgency=high

  * Even more bitcoin fee optimizations - with rising Bitcoin prices every
    little satoshi helps.

    central location.
  * The new history drawer calculates your overall percentage change for each of
    your Exodus exchanges.
  * The new contact Exodus button in the history drawer to allow users to make
    contact with Exodus and pre-fill exchange details so our support team can

exodus (1.38.1-1) xenial; urgency=high

  * A few regions around the world continued to report Bitcoin balance issues
    after rescanning. Exodus has put additional servers in place to safeguard
    against this error.

 -- R. Douglas Barbieri <doug@dooglio.net>  Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:37:53 -0800

exodus (1.38.0-2) xenial; urgency=high

  * We got rid of the cobwebs and made big code optimizations across the
    entire application. Exodus is now 20% (4MB) smaller overall!
  * Adjusted Ethereum address failure messages to read more like a human and
    less like an Ethereum robot.
  * Notification banners now appear in the proper stacking order. Previously we
    had a few users tell us, at small window sizes, notification banners were
    not stacking correctly and the buttons were not working.
  * More spacing adjustment have been made to the help section. Also button
    sizes have been improved to contain longer items like email addresses. We
    are looking at you support@exodus.io.
  * Fixed the typo in the QTUM asset in the settings section.
  * The upgrade button now marks your current version to allow for easier
    upgrades and upgrade notifications.
  * Fixed color borders in the backup section. Also made spacing adjustments to
    the entire backup section for greater clarity.
  * Adjusted the fiat amounts in the sidebar for users will large balances.
  * Previously users with large balances were experiencing ugly wrapping text.
  * Adjusted the sizing in the help section. There was some tiny text that was
    hard to read in a few sections. This should be easier for everyone to
    quickly browse and skim now.
  * Portfolio
  * Long digit amounts (16 decimal places in ETH and ERC20) have been trimmed
    down to 8 in the portfolio. This prevents ugly number wrapping on small
    screens and window sizes, keeping the view clean and tidy.
  * A rounding bug that caused a few users‚Äô portfolio total values to only show
    99% vs. 100% has been fixed. Although this was only a display bug, everyone
    should now be at 100%!
  * Color adjustments have been made to further separate out Bitcoin from Bitcoin Cash.
  * The design team was also busy optimizing the portfolio to make room for
    everyone who wants to add 3 or 4 rows of assets on tiny laptop screens. They
    stayed up late to tweak every pixel to make small size laptop users rejoice
    on no extra scrolling.
  * Exchange
  * Exodus now checks for exchange pricing data twice as fast. This will help
    everyone when exchanging assets to make sure with fast-moving markets they
    can catch the best and latest price swings.
    To increase transparency, exchange rate modifications now have the ability
    to show the rate per asset on both sides of the pair. To toggle this view
    click on the rate text under the exchange button.
    In addition to Exodus being the only wallet to show fiat values in the
    exchange this new rate toggle feature brings further transparency to view
    all angles of asset exchanges inside Exodus. With fiat values, and now both
    asset pairs toggling, Exodus is proud to be one of the most transparent
    exchange experiences. Although Exodus exchanges will always be slightly
    higher than a traditional exchange, or using ShapeShift directly, Exodus
    funnels all revenue back into the core product and customer support team. We
    are proud to maintain a free product and service funded by exchange volume.
    As opposed to doing an ICO, Exodus continues to focus on product. We believe
    over time as we continue to provide value for the digital asset ecosystem
    exchange revenue will grow and continue to support the brand, company and
    mission to help individuals control their future wealth!
    Exodus now extends users a few seconds grace period to cancel an exchange in
    progress. This brief buffer time will help users who accidentally started an
    exchange and also help users to double check after clicking the exchange
    button they are sure they want to complete an exchange.
  * Wallet
  * Exodus now supports exporting your Bitcoin Cash xpub. This feature is
    accessible for advanced users in the Developer Menu.
    Per feedback from the community we adjusted the spacing on the receive
    address to make sure there was plenty of room around the address at all
    window sizes.
  * Fixed the border style consistency on the send-all button and QR code button
    to match. Thanks to our eagle-eyed development community for catching these
    pixels out of place!
  * Exodus now triple checks Ethereum addresses, and all assets based on
    Ethereum, [ Aragon (ANT), Augur (REP), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Civic
    (CVC), District0x (DNT), EOS (EOS), FunFair (FUN), Gnosis (GNO), Golem
    (GNT), OmiseGo (OMG) and Salt (SALT) ] that are scanned in with a QR code. We
    have noticed there are some wallets not including checksum safety precautions
    on Ethereum and Ethereum token addresses. If Exodus detects one of these
    addresses it now warns you to check each character of the address to make sure
    it is correct.
  * Exodus now properly separates out fees from the sending amounts in the
    advanced export transactions list. Although balances were always accurate this
    gives all the accountants, and everyone wanting to know down to the satoshi,
    how your wallet and transactions have built up over time. You can find
    this feature in the developer menu under Developer > Assets > Asset >
  * Export Transactions‚Ä¶
  * Exodus further has optimized Bitcoin related display balances.
    Further speed and reliability optimizations have been made to monitor
    incoming Ethereum and all Ethereum token transactions.
  * A link to the address you are sending to is now live in the send window
    confirmation. This link allows you to click the address you are sending
    to and view it on the blockchain before you send. This is yet another
    way to make sure you are sending to a correct address. It also is a
    great way to see and check address you have sent to previously.
  * Exodus now properly sizes and prevents text wrap on long Ethereum
    address vs. shorter Bitcoin addresses. Ethereum addresses are natively
    longer and they need special care in the entire application.
  * Send all on Ethereum sometimes left a few annoying trailing pieces of
    ether in the wallet. We were as annoyed as you when we saw wallets with
    a balance of 0.0000000000000001 ETH. We made sure to kick this to the
    curb.
  * Advanced users using your XPub in the dev console will now be able to
    properly export addresses. (We realize this may be only about 10 people
    but boy will these advanced nerds be happy about this)
    We sent our design team into the send model to make some additional font
    and spacing adjustments for clarity.
  * Added colored addresses on the sending confirmation screen to further
    give another visual cue of the asset you are sending too. These subtle
    refinements help people not send Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum
  * Classic to Ethereum.
  * Adjusted the center and alignment of the refresh icons and the
    animations. These are the crazy little things our designers stay up late
    at night to fix that no one will notice. ;)
  * Updated the sizing on the transaction history details drawer. These were
    previously small fonts that were harder to read. We redesigned the
    drawers a bit to be able to bump the font sizes slightly. This resulted
    in greater readability and consistency across all wallets and
    transactions.
