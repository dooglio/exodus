exodus (1.37.0-1) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added District0x and Funfair.
  * Exodus now pre-fills your own Exodus BCH wallet address when using the
  * Exodus Bitcoin Cash claim function. This feature is perfect for users who
    are on other wallets and have not claimed Bitcoin Cash yet.
  * If you have your Bitcoin Cash trapped in another wallet here is a great
    video by BTC Sessions on how to import your 12-word seed from other wallets
    and claim your Bitcoin Cash!
  * Exodus now has a new font for the navigation and portfolio section. This
    font allows for larger numbers and text on all screen sizes. As our assets
    and portfolios increase, readability (and being able to fit more items on
    the screen) becomes important to customers holding a larger portfolio of assets.
  * Long digit amounts (16 decimal places in ETH and ERC20) have been trimmed
    down to 8 in the portfolio. This prevents ugly number wrapping on small
    screens and window sizes, keeping the view clean and tidy.
  * A rounding bug that caused a few usersâ€™ portfolio total values to only show
    99% vs. 100% has been fixed. Although this was only a display bug, everyone
    should now be at 100%!
  * district0x (DNT) is here! Upgrade to version 1.37.0 to send and receive
    district0x.
  * FunFair (FUN) is here! Upgrade to version 1.37.0 to send and receive
    FunFair.
  * The send window has an updated look. Users can now quickly type in asset or
    fiat values. There is also a new send all button. This window will soon
    bring advanced sending options for power users.
  * A few users reported older transactions not having pricing details in the
    detail display drawer. This has been fixed.
  * You can now exchange any asset for district0x (DNT).
  * You can now exchange any asset for FunFair (FUN).
