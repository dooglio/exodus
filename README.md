# exodus-debian-packager
This contains the necessary code to create an Ubuntu Debian package for the Exodus GUI

This archive has a debian folder, plus make file infrastructure to download then unpack the
distribution zip file from the main servers, then construct the package itself.

Presently there is no PPA nor debian source servers available, but this may come at a later date.
